      The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of
      gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.

    <p class="article-paragraph">
      So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?
    </p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">
      Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming headphones
      are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment.
      However, they possess qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too.
      Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval, accurate
      sound stage and immersive sound experience make them feasible to double up
      as a pair of gaming headphones.
    </p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">
      However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they
      have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic like
      the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
    </p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">
      A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous
      for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with
      Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his
      games.
    </p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">

      setup for gaming.
